# vBconsole

This was one of the very first projects I ever created in Python back in 2013. It was a Metasploit like console for vBulletin exploits. This was a project I made just for fun and to get myself more comfortable with the language. 

Python2 is needed.
Usage: python vbconsole.py

Main screen with 'show all' exploits command.
