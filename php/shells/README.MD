# PHP Webshells

## TeamPS Shell (teamps.php)
This was the official shell for p0wersurge.com. This was a very popular shell back in the day. Some of the functions were wrote by a friend KrypTiK.

## Plum Shell (plum.php)
This was a shell I wrote a few years after the TeamPS shell. This was mainly just for fun at the time.

## Backbox Terminal Shell (command_line.php)
This was an experimental shell that I created for fun awhile back. It has a draggable Backbox terminal window that works similarily than a real terminal. This was never completed and still contains many of bugs and incomplete areas.
