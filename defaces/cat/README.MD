# Dancing Cat

This is by far my favorite and most recognizable deface I have created. The versions I am posting are the most recent iteration from 2018. However, this deface has gone through many iterations over the years. The idea for this deface came from a friend that goes by BoxHead way back in 2010/2011. He was the admin of belegit.net and had a very simple version of the dancing cat as the index. Thanks to Wayback Machine the original can still be seen here: [belegit.net](https://web.archive.org/web/20111122061726/http://belegit.net:80/). For some reason that index stuck with me and from that point I knew I wanted to make my own version of it. Over the next few weeks, I combed the internet for the source to the ascii art to see if there was more to it. I eventually found the original gif file of the dancing cat, which had more frames to it. I was also able to find another gif with a different animation to utilize. I then converted the gif into frames, and then each frame was converted to ascii art. Once that was done I rewrote the animation logic in JS/jQuery and added a few things. 

The 3 deface files here are a bit different:
## new_cat.html
This version is the simple version with no keybindings. 
## new_cat2.html
This version is the same as new_cat.html, but has key bindings. The keybinding info is at the top of the script.
## new_cat3.html
This version is the second animation with no keybindings. 



These scripts contain a Youtube url variable, which will no longer work due to how browsers handle autoplay nowadays.
