** Updated to run on PHP7 using PDO 08/26/2019 **
** Tested on PHP Version 7.1.8 **

MySQL Dumper v2.2 Copyright © 2019

[+]Notes: The script may timeout at the end of the database dump. That is due to the compression.
[+]The database still dumped and can be found in the "msd" directory. I may update with a better compression method.

How to use:
Unzip the file in a writeable directory.
Go to /msd/install.php
It may find vBulletin config information and fill the form out automatically. If not enter it manually.
Click install and enjoy.

This uses a staggered dump process to dump larger databases.
I have been able to dump a 2GB database just fine with this.
As far as my testing goes it should dump most DB's with ease.
There are a lot of variables that go into a server, therefore I can not gurantee your experience will be the same.
The script may timeout for you. I think that it should work well for the most part.
If you have any problems with it or suggestions you can email me at: r00t@p0wersurge or find me at http://p0wersurge.com.

Some features:
Dump DB
Drop DB
View tables in DB
Dump single table
Drop table
Prune table (TRUNCATE)
Insert row into table
Explore inside of table
Delete row in table
Edit row in table
Search table
vBulletin hash dumper
Install script (install.php)
Will search for possible vB config files and fill the install form out automatically if found.

Please keep this text file in the folder and visit: http://p0wersurge.com.

Updates in 2.1:
Staggered compression for bigger DB's and tables. The script shouldn't time out now when compressing a larger DB. Compresses 50 MB of data at a time.
Edited CSS
Just edited a few other things.


I hope you all enjoy this tool, Plum
