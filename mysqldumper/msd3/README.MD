# MySQLDumper v3

This version of MySQLDumper was something I made to experiment with using Ajax and JS to handle requests and responses. There wasn't very good error handling so there was a lot of issues with the script breaking with no info as to what happened. This version needed some polish to get it perfect but I never took the time to update it. This version is currently not compliant with PHP7.
